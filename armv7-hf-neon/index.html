This is a test build collection of libretro cores, for armv7-hf-neon platform. <br/>
It is suitable for machines with Linux OS, architecture ARMv7, 32-bit. CPU should support hard-float and NEON (Raspberry Pi 2 as an example).<br/>
<br/>
To download cores from here, edit your retroarch.cfg, and point buildbot_core_download_url to here:<br/>
core_updater_buildbot_cores_url = "https://zoltanvb.github.io/armv7-hf-neon/"<br/>
Then use online updater / core downloader.<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is an unofficial repo, created as a test for a cross-compilation environment. Keep following things in mind:
<ul>
  <li>Cores are compiled with "unix-armv7-hardfloat-neon" target. It may result in lower performance than a build targeted to the specific HW platform such as "rpi2".</li>
  <li>All possible cores are compiled, without consideration. So several of them may be unusably slow.</li>
  <li>There may be compilation errors as well. If you find a core that is not working at all, and you're willing to do some testing, open an issue to: https://github.com/zoltanvb/zoltanvb.github.io/issues</li>
</ul>
